# Binary Search Tree Visualization using C++, SFML, and ImGui

This project aims to provide a visual representation of binary search trees using C++ for the logic, SFML for graphics rendering, and ImGui for creating a user-friendly interface. Binary search trees are fundamental data structures used in computer science for efficient searching and sorting operations.

## Features:

1. **Binary Search Tree Visualization:** See how binary search trees are constructed and manipulated in real-time through a graphical interface.
   
2. **Insertion, Removal, Search and Cleaning operations:** Interactively add, remove, search and clear nodes from the binary search tree to observe how the structure adjusts accordingly.

3. **Visual Feedback:** Nodes are visually represented with animations for insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

## Requirements:

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
- SFML library (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
- ImGui library (Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface).
